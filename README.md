# Replicates Itself VIRUS
# A Simple Python Script that Mimics Virus-like Behavior (Replicates Itself)

This project demonstrates a **basic Python script that mimics virus-like behavior** by replicating itself. It is intended for educational purposes, allowing students and developers to learn about the mechanisms behind self-replicating code and how to defend against it in cybersecurity.

## Project Overview

The script demonstrates a core concept found in some types of computer viruses: **self-replication**. The script copies itself to another file in the same directory, showcasing how malicious code can spread through replication. This project is designed to help students and educators understand how viruses operate and explore how to develop antivirus mechanisms to counter such behavior.

> **Note**: This project is for educational purposes only and should not be used maliciously.

## Features

- **Self-replication**: The script copies itself to a new file in the same directory.
- **Simple Python Code**: Written in Python, making it easy to understand for beginners.
- **Teaches Cybersecurity Concepts**: Useful for learning how to detect and prevent virus-like behavior.

## How It Works

1. The script gets its own file path using the `__file__` attribute.
2. It defines a destination file name (e.g., `replica.py`).
3. The script then uses the `shutil.copy()` function to copy itself to the new destination file.
4. Once the replication is successful, it outputs a message confirming the new file's creation.

### Example Code:

```python
import os
import shutil

# Get the current script path
current_script = __file__

# Define the destination where the script will replicate itself
destination = "replica.py"

# Replicate the script to the destination file
shutil.copy(current_script, destination)

# Output to inform the user about the replication process
print(f"The script '{current_script}' has successfully replicated itself as '{destination}'.")

# Check if the new file exists and print a message
if os.path.exists(destination):
    print(f"Replication confirmed! '{destination}' now exists in the same directory.")
else:
    print("Replication failed!")
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Basic knowledge of file operations in Python
Installation
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Nelzouki22/Simple-Virus-like-Script.git
Navigate to the project folder:

bash
Copy code
cd Simple-Virus-like-Script
Run the script:

bash
Copy code
python virus_replica.py
How to Use
Run the script: Once you execute the script, it will create a copy of itself as replica.py.
Observe the replication: Check the directory to see the newly created file.
Educational Purpose
This project is a learning tool for understanding how malicious software can replicate itself and spread. It is also a starting point for developing defenses against self-replicating malware.

Next Steps:
Develop a detection mechanism that identifies files attempting to replicate themselves.
Implement antivirus-like behavior to prevent or delete these replicated files.
